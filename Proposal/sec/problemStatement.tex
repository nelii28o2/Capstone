\autsection{Problem Statement}{Samuel Rodríguez} %The problem explained

Most educational institutions manually grade coding assignments completed by
students \cite{Cheang2003}. Manual evaluation of code takes a great deal of time
and is prone to bad evaluations due to the substantial amount of different ways
a program can be written. This leads the grader to only evaluate the program's
output based on an specific input. Such a method of evaluation can be
maliciously exploited and does not measure code quality at all. Missing the
evaluation of code quality and other important details can lead professors to
evaluate students inconsistently. Currently, most professors and teaching
assistants evaluate output by manually importing code into a workstation, most
probably the grader's own personal machine, and then manually executing the
program through some test cases. This is highly insecure because the code is not
properly sandboxed \footnote{In computer security, a sandbox is a security
mechanism for separating running programs. It is often used to execute untested
code, or untrusted programs.}. The code could be malicious and cause damage to
the running workstation or could even get a hold of very sensitive data without
the consent of the grader \cite{Cheang2003}.

Jesús E. Luzón \cite{Chiki}, a TA from the University of Puerto Rico at
Mayagüez, comments when asked about the time it takes to grade a 50 line coding
assignment: \begin{quote} ``The way I grade the assignments is by creating a
testing project that only includes the student's code. I check out the project
from the students repository and then run the code and compare the output. For a
well written assignment, It takes me about 3 to 4 minutes to evaluate it. But
for an assignment that has errors, it takes me about double the time: from 6 to
8 minutes. This happens because I need to figure out where exactly the error
comes from, so that I can give the student some useful feedback." \end{quote}
Luzón grades an assigment weekly. When asked about how many students he grades,
he comments: \begin{quote} ``I have 23 students, which doesn't seem like too
many, but the time it takes to grade their assignments adds up quickly. In the
worst case, I can spend 3 hours grading a single assignment." \end{quote}

%Here we hit stakeholders, how the project solves the problem and the scope of
%such solution

The proposed project will solve four problems that manual grading has:
\begin{itemize}
\item Time consuming grading process.
\item Slow and ineffective communication between students and graders.
\item Insecure evaluation because submitted code might be malicious.
\item Absence of code quality evaluation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Time}
Grading programming assignments is time-consuming and tedious, graders have
dozens of examinations to do and eventually the human factor gets involve, as
the process keeps getting longer the human starts getting tire and his
effectiveness to grade is reduced affecting the grades of the assignments.
The solution solves this problem by automation. The process of verifying a
code's correctness and quality is done automatically and the grader is notified
so he can confirm the evaluation and provide feedback.
\subsection{Communication}
Due to the grading process undesirable trends have been seen. Students don't
usually seek their TA for consulting due to the lack of feedback given in the
grading of the assignments. Moreover due to the time it takes to grade
assignments if any feedback is given it is less effective because by the time
the assignments are evaluated these are no longer fresh in the student's mind
\cite{Cheang2003}. The solution solves this problem by providing in-line and
overall commenting on graded assignments. The grading personnel is notified when
an assignment has been submitted so they can quickly provided feedback to
possibly give a chance for the student to re-submit their work.
\subsection{Security}
Manual grading requires the students to e-mail a softcopy of the assignment with
an optional printed documentation containing the source code. If the TA decides
to import the students program, he will be exposing his computer to
malicious code. The proposed solutions intends to solve this problem by running
the code in a contained environment. A students code will be executed with
limited privileges, time and memory.
\subsection{Code Quality}
The process of manual evaluation of assignments leads to some verification of
the code's quality. Specifically maintainability, as some graders observe for
structured code, logical variables names and good documentation. However,
manual evaluation misses other aspects of code quality. Performance, efficiency 
and robustness. The proposed solution will do, to some extend, code quality
evaluation. Performance will be tested by providing time and memory consumption
limits. Robustness will be evaluated by testing the student's code against
extreme cases. Some aspects of maintainability will be automatically verified
with the use of linters \footnote{In computer programming, lint, is the name
given to a particular program that flags suspicious usage in software written
in any computer language. Lint-like tools generally perform static analysis of
source code. Lint as a term can also refer more broadly to syntactic
discrepancies in general.}.
