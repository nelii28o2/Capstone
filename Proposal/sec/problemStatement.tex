\autsection{Problem Statement}{Samuel Rodríguez} %The problem explained

Most educational institutions manually grade coding assignments completed by
students \cite{Cheang2003}. Manual evaluation of code takes a great deal of time
and is prone to bad evaluations due to the substantial amount of different ways
a program can be written. This leads the grader to only evaluate the program's
output based on an specific input. Such a method of evaluation can be
maliciously exploited and does not measure code quality at all. Missing the
evaluation of code quality and other important details can lead professors to
evaluate students inconsistently. Currently, most professors and teaching
assistants evaluate output by manually importing code into a workstation, most
probably the grader's own personal machine, and then manually executing the
program through some test cases. This is highly insecure because the code is not
properly sandboxed \footnote{In computer security, a sandbox is a security
mechanism for separating running programs. It is often used to execute untested
code, or untrusted programs.}. The code could be malicious and cause damage to
the running workstation or could even get a hold of very sensitive data without
the consent of the grader \cite{Cheang2003}.

% Quotes from TAs  

Zach Cross \cite{Zach}, a Teaching Assistant (TA) from the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, comments when he is asked if he has a grading tool
for students code: \begin{quote} ``Nothing well integrated and highly
functional, mostly hacky bash/python scripts..." \end{quote} Moreover, he
comments on the current system his institution uses for grading: \begin{quote}
``We don't have a clean web interface or anything and they aren't functional
in the sense that they break for most assignments as soon as errors occur e.g.
they can grade the 100\%'s but not much else." \end{quote}

Jesús E. Luzón \cite{Chiki}, a TA from the University of Puerto Rico at
Mayagüez, comments when asked about the time it takes to grade a 50 line coding
assignment: \begin{quote} ``The way I grade the assignments is by creating a
testing project that only includes the student's code. I check out the project
from the students repository and then run the code and compare the output. For a
well written assignment, It takes me about 3 to 4 minutes to evaluate it. But
for an assignment that has errors, it takes me about double the time: from 6 to
8 minutes. This happens because I need to figure out where exactly the error
comes from, so that I can give the student some useful feedback." \end{quote}
Luzón grades an assigment weekly. When asked about how many students he grades,
he comments: \begin{quote} ``I have 23 students, which doesn't seem like too
many, but the time it takes to grade their assignments adds up quickly. In the
worst case, I can spend 3 hours grading a single assignment." \end{quote}

%Here we hit stakeholders, how the project solves the problem and the scope of
%such solution

The proposed project will solve four problems that manual grading has:
\begin{itemize}
\item Time consuming grading process.
\item Slow and ineffective communication between students and graders.
\item Insecure evaluation because submitted code might be malicious.
\item Absence of code quality evaluation.
\end{itemize}
