\subsection{Previous Work Experience}

The members of Team Aguacate have known each other for several years, many of
which have been spent developing projects for several courses and
extracurricular activities. They have participated together in programming
competitions, hackathons and projects, such as the Microprocessor Interfacing
course project on the spring semester of 2013, WaveSphere \cite{Micro2}. These
previous experiences have allowed the team to build their teamwork abilities.

The team's participation in programming competition have exposed them to several 
online judges for programming competitions, such as UVa
\cite{UVA} and SPOJ \cite{SPOJ}. Team Aguacate has also gone through the experience
of submitting code for programming labs. These previous experiences has lead the team 
came up with the idea of creating something similar to an online judge to 
facilitate not only their own work by making a tool to turn in programming 
assignments easier and getting grades faster, but also the instructors' work that have to 
grade hundreds of these assignments.

\subsection{Similar Projects}

Educational Institutions outside of Puerto Rico have similar systems to the one
being proposed. In 1994 the University of Maryland presented Kassandra: The
Automatic Grading System \cite{Matt1994}. As the title suggests, Kassandra is an
automatic grading system that is used for grading assignments in scientific
computing. This system is used by students to check the correctness of his/her
program assignments. This is achieved by comparing the program output with an
expected result. In 2000 the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and the Microsoft
Research Corporation developed Curator, a web-based electronic submission that
supports automated grading of elementary programming assignments. \cite{Curator}
Its grading mechanism is similar to Kassandra, the programs are compiled and
their output result is tested against a correct output from an specific input.
A few years ago, in the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez (UPRM), a TA for the Data 
Structures
course and former student, José Santuche \cite{Santuche}, developed a simple
script that would checkout his students' code, run some tests, compare the
output and send an email to the student with the results. However it was
unreliable and had to be manually changed between assignments. The most
currently competitive product is another web-based tool named Web-CAT. Web-CAT
is an open source automated grading system that is used to grade students on how
well they test their own code. This is different that just comparing output results. 
Web-CAT needs to be installed on an institution's own infrastructure \cite{WebCat}.
Another similar product is Praktomat \cite{Praktomat}, an open source web-based
tool for automatic grading. This product differs in that it also enables peer-
to-peer reviews, but does not have a sophisticated testing framework.

%We need more advantage-disadvantage and comparison to the proposed product

\subsection{Proposed Approach}

From the aforementioned projects, Panda Code Reviews (Panda) integrates
correctness checking and privacy awareness. Panda differs from the previous
efforts because it is fully web-based and hosted in the cloud out of the box, so
there is no installation needed and the update process is transparent to
institutions. Competing products, like Web-CAT, Praktomat, Curator, and
Kassandra require additional infrastructure and a painful set up process. They
all have the hassle of having to manually back up the database and distressingly
updating the infrastructure's software. Moreover, Panda provide the missing
feature in all other similar products, the code quality analysis. This means that the tool creates
reports of the code's quality that help the students excel in their area and
follow best coding practices. It will also include in-line commenting
capabilities for enhancing the communication between the graders and students.

\subsection{Project Importance}

As stated by previous and current TAs from UPRM, such as José
Santuche, it is important to have an automatic grading tool because they become
exhausted of having to grade the same assignment over and over again, it is a
slow and irritating process, especially when the graders have hundreds of
students. As Jesús E. Luzón mentioned (quoted above), with only 23 students,
grading a single assignment might take him up to 3 hours of his time. As
Santuche mentions: \begin{quote} ``Since the process of grading is so exhaustive,
the graders normally begin by verifying all the details, but at some point they
just verify the output without looking at the code." \end{quote}. From the
students perspective, the process of submitting code and waiting for a grade is
slow and annoying as well. It is prone to mistakes when sending an e-mail or virus infections if submitting the assignment by some removable and portable storage device. Panda aims to tackle these problems by providing a
centralized and fully integrated web-based system in which students will be able
to submit their assignments and it will automatically grade them based on code
quality and test cases submitted by the TA or professor. The automatic grading
will not be applied immediately to the student, since the professor could
override the system and use the code quality tools to determine a grade for the
student. This tools helps the grader as much as possible, without removing power
from the grader. This project will incorporate the use of repositories, a tool
that is not much used in UPRM, so that it also helps students to learn
how to use version control and source code management technologies. All of
these solutions that the tool will provide makes it a great marketable product.
Institutions can greatly benefit by purchasing the service of this project.

\subsection{Standards and Regulations}

Since the tool will manage student data, it needs to be secure and private. It
also needs to maintain the test cases uploaded by the instructor private to the
students. To maintain the information secure and not visible by anybody, an
HTTPS connection will always be required between Panda and the client's
computers. All information will be encrypted in the system, including credential
information, account data, and repository data. Also, a very sophisticated,
third party cloud serving infrastructure will be used to guarantee data backup
and up to 99.99\% uptime: ensuring that the system will be available always when
needed.
