\subsection{Previous Work Experience}
The members of Team Aguacate have known each other for several years, many of which have been spent developing project for several courses and extracurricular activities. They have been together in programming competitions, hackathons and projects, such as the Microprossesor Interfacing course project last semester \cite{Micro2}. These previous experiences have allowed the team to build their teamwork abilities.

Since there are several online judges for programming competitions, such as UVa \cite{UVA}, and since they have been through the experience of having to submit code for programming labs, the team came up with the idea of using something similar to an online judge to facilitate not only their lifes by making an easier tool to turn in programming assignments and getting grades faster, but also the instructor's that have to grade hundreds of these.

\subsection{Similar Projects}

In 1994, University of Maryland presented Kassandra: The Automatic Grading System \cite{Matt1994}. As the title suggests, Kassandra is an automatic grading system that is used for grading assignments in scientific computing. This system is used by students to check the correctness of his/her program assignments. This is achieved by comparing the program output with the expected result. A few years ago, a teaching asssitant (TA) for the Data Structures course and former student at our University, José Santuche, developed a small script that would checkout his students' code, run some tests, compare the output and send an email to the student with the results.

\subsection{Our Approach}

From the aforementioned projects, Panda Code Review (PCR) integrates correctness checking and privacy awareness.  PCR differs from the previous efforts because it is web based instead of a desktop application. PCR aims to provide a complete grading tool that, in addition of correctness checking, it will include code quality checking, in-line commenting capabilities for the TA to put comments if needed, an easy way to upload code, among other distinctive features.

\subsection{Project Importance}

As stated by previous and current TAs from our University, such as José Santuche, it is important to have an automatic grading tool because they get tired of having to grade the same thing over and over again, it is a slow and annoying process, especially when you have a hundred students. They start looking at all the details, but at some point they just check the output without looking at the code. From the students perspective, the process of submitting code and waiting for a grade is slow and annoying, too.  PCR aims to tackle these problems by providing a centralized, web-based system in which students will be able to submit their assignments and it will automatically grade them based on test cases submitted by the TA or professor and the quality of the code. Our project will incorporate the use of repositories, a tool that is not much used in our University, so that it also helps students to learn how to use new technologies.

\subsection{Standards and Regulations}

Since our tool will manage student data, it needs to be secure and private.
