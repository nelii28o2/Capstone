Accurate estimates of cost is extremely important for ensuring that the team
does not go over budget. Since this is a software project, the majority of the
cost is attributed to Software Developers and Human Resources. Development costs
remain low as long as computer workstations and an internet connection is
provided. At the last step of the development of the project, an Amazon Web
Services EC2 account needs to be purchased in order to deploy the system.

\subsection{List of Components}

\begin{itemize}
\item 2 Workstations minimum (\$0 - Provided by team)
\item Amazon Web Services EC2 (\$44 monthly after deployment)

\end{itemize}
