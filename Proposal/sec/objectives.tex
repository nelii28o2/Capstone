\subsection{Objectives Outcomes and Metrics}
To achieve the code review system, the team will accomplish the following
objectives in the next 2 months:

\begin{itemize}
\item Create a visually modern front end interface that includes an account manager,
repository manager, test manager, source code viewer, source code annotator and
source code quality analyzer.
\item Build a testing framework that will run tests for programs written in
C++, Java and Javascript.
\item Create a test coverage analyzer and integrate it with the testing
framework.
\item Construct a code quality framework that will include linters for C++,
Java and Javascript.
\item Create an accounts and repository back end module.
\item Create a back end REST API for communications between the front end interface
and both the testing and code quality frameworks.

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Deliverables}

The deliverables for this project will be a cloud based web application with the
featured Code Review tool. TA and Student accounts will be able to be created by
the client, and it will be able to be used immediately after launch.
