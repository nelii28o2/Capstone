\autsection{Impact}{Daniel Santiago}

We aim to impact Educational Institutions, specifically Computer Science
instructors that have to manually evaluate code submitted by students. We will
impact such community by providing an easy to use solution that will save them
time and money when evaluating student's coding assignments. In the long-term we
will also increase the student's skills in programming areas by giving
recommendations on their codes referencing well proven standards and patterns.
Moreover by making instructors save time they can be more engaging in other
activities involving the students. From a different perspective, we will also
decrease the chances of computer viruses being spread trough the old evaluations
methods.
