We aim to impact Educational Institutions, specifically Computer Science instructors that have to manually evaluate code submitted by students. We will impact such community by providing an easy to use solution that will save them time and money when evaluating students codes. In the long-term we will also increase the students skills in programming areas by giving recommendations on their codes referencing well proven standards and patterns. Moreover by making instructors save time they can be more engaging in other activities involving the students. From a different perspective, we will also decrease the chances of computer viruses being spread trough the old evaluations methods.
