\autsection{Impacts}{Daniel Santiago}

This project aims to impact Educational Institutions, specifically Computer
Science, Software Engineering and Computer Engineering instructors that have to
manually evaluate code submitted by students. It will impact this community by
providing an easy to use solution that will save them time when evaluating
student's coding assignments. In the long-term, it will also increase the
student's skills in programming areas by giving recommendations on their code;
referencing well-proven standards and patterns.

\subsection{Commitments}
The system:
\begin{itemize}
\item Can manage accounts (create, edit and delete).
\item Can receive code submissions.
\item Will support Java and Javascript code.
\item Can evaluate submitted code.
\item Can present results of evaluations.
\item Will enable communication between the grader and the student through
inline comments.
\item Will display linter's results of submitted code in the web application.
\item Will send emails to students and graders when code is evaluated.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item The web application is not guaranteed to work properly on non supported
browsers. See Section~\ref{sec:stand} to see a list of expected supported browsers.
\item It will not be able to process programming languages other than the
supported ones.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Legal Commitments}

The licenses for the tools that the team intends to use to build this system
will be non propagated (i.e not Copylefted), permissive open source licenses
e.g. MIT License.
