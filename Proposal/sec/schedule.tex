\autsection{Schedule}{Nelián Colón}

One of the most important things to do when planning a project is to set up the
work schedule, divide tasks and estimate the time of completion.

\subsection{Gantt Chart}

A Gantt chart showing the project schedule is included separately with this
proposal. The project's critical path is shown in red. Usual work schedule does
not include Saturdays and Sundays, but some tasks were put on weekends to avoid
a bigger critical path. If this was not done, the whole Implementation phase
would be on the critical path, and that is where it is most likely for problems
to arise. Weekends work hours might be included or excluded depending on project
progress.

\subsection{Work Breakdown Structure}

The Work Breakdown Structure can be observed in the Gannt Chart included. It
shows the tasks hierarchy (outlined), people responsible of completing them, and
a time estimation of task completion. Critical path tasks are highlighted. To
see the cost associated to task completions see Section~\ref{sec:Budget}.
