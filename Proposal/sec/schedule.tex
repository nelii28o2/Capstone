\autsection{Schedule}{Nelián Colón}

A Gantt chart showing the project schedule is included separately with this

not include Saturdays and Sundays, but weekends work hours might be included or
excluded in the future depending on project progress.

The Work Breakdown Structure can be observed in the Gannt Chart included. It
shows the tasks hierarchy (outlined), people responsible of completing them, and
a time estimation of task completion. Critical path tasks are highlighted. To
see the cost associated to task completions see Section~\ref{sec:Budget}.
