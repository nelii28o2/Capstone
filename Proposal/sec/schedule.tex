\autsection{Schedule}{Nelián Colón}

One of the most important things to do when
planning a project is to set up the work schedule, divide tasks and estimate
time of completion.

\subsection{Gantt Chart}

A Gantt chart showing the project schedule is included
separately with this proposal. Project critical path is shown in red. Usual work schedule
does not include Saturdays and Sundays, but some tasks were put on weekends to avoid a
bigger critical path. If this was not done, the whole Implementation phase would be on the
critical path, and that is where more problems are likely to arise.
Weekends work hours might be included or excluded depending on project
progress. 

\subsection{Work Breakdown Structure}

The Work Breakdown Structure, showing the
tasks hierarchy (outlined), people responsible  of completing them, and a time
estimation of task completion, can be observed in the
Gantt Chart included. Critical path tasks are highlighted. To see the cost 
associated to task completions see Section~\ref{sec:Budget}.
