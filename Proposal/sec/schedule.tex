\autsection{Schedule}{Nelián Colón}

One of the most important things to do when
planning a project is to set up the work schedule, divide tasks and estimate
time of completion.

\subsection{Gantt Chart}

A Gantt chart showing the project schedule is included
separately with this proposal. Project critical path is shown in red.

\subsection{Work Breakdown Structure}

tasks hierarchy (outlined), people responsible  of completing them, a time
