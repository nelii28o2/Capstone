\autsection{Schedule}{Nelián Colón}

One of the most important things to do when
planning a project is to set up the work schedule, divide tasks and estimate
time of completion.

\subsection{Gantt Chart}

A Gantt chart showing the project schedule is included
separately with this proposal. Project critical path is shown in red.

\subsection{Work Breakdown Structure}

The Work Breakdown Structure, showing the
tasks hierarchy (outlined), people responsible  of completing them, and a time
estimation of task completion, can be observed in the
Gantt Chart included. Critical path tasks are highlighted. To see the cost 
associated to task completions see section~\ref{sec:Budget}.
