\autsection{Assessment Methods}{Nelián Colón}

To help manage the project and collect information on each member's individual progress on their tasks, the project manager decided to use Zoho Projects. This tool allows to divide tasks. It also helps to know which tasks are still to be completed, and lets each user specify how much they have progressed in a specific task. The team will also have a Git repository where all the code that has been written will be stored, so that progress can also be measured from the amount of code already written. Project reports will also reside in a Git repository.
