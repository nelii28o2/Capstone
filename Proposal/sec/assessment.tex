\autsection{Assessment Methods}{Nelián Colón}

To help manage the project and collect information on each member's individual
progress on their tasks, the project manager decided to use Zoho Projects. This
web tool allows to divide tasks. It also helps to determine which tasks are
still need to be completed, and lets each team member specify how much they have
progressed in a specific task. The team will also have a Git repository where
all the code that has been written will be stored, so that progress can be
monitored from the amount of code already written. Project reports will also
reside in a Git repository. Team Aguacate will work in sprints and each task
will have a weight according to their priority, which will be decided in the
sprint planning meeting. Project progress can also be measured by the weight of
the tasks done. In summary, the project overall progress will be measured by the weight assigned to each task during the sprint planning meeting, and the actual work done will be checked by looking at the members percentage of work done that he/she puts in Zoho. In addition, the percentage of work done will be monitored by looking at how much code has been written.
