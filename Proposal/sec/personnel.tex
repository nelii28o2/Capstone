\subsection{Training Needs}

For the development of this project, the members of the team have enough
experience to work with their respective tasks. Should they find something they
do not know how to do, they are responsible of learning about the new
technologies they have to work on, self train themselves through courses or
readings, and ask for help when needed. No special training is needed for the developers nor the end users.

related matter concerning expertise or knowledge the team does not possess. The consultants that the team identified are the following:

\item Database Management and Web Development: Dr. Manuel Rodríguez
