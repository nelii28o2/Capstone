\subsection{Meetings and Work Hours}
Team Aguacate will weekly stand-up meetings on Tuesdays from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm to discuss progress and project details. In each meeting, each member will state their progress, any needs he/she might have and if their schedule has changed. Work hours on assigned tasks will occur every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9:30 am to 11:20 am unless there is a seminar scheduled for that day. Other work hours will be every possible day from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm, minimum. The team will work on sprints, so a sprint planning meeting will occur on Thursdays from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm whenever a new sprint comes.

\subsection{Team Management}
The meetings will be as described above and other meetings will be scheduled when needed. One of the purposes of these meetings is to make sure that each team member is aware of the other members' progress and concerns. Changes to these hours are to be discussed and decisions will depend on majority vote and team leader opinion. Each member will work in at least two modules. Each task will have a leader and an assistant. The leader of each task is responsible for it and the assistant will assist whenever the leader gets stuck.
