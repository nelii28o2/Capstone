\autsection{Market Overview}{Daniel Santiago}

Zach Cross \cite{Zach}, a TA from the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, comments when he is asked if he has
a grading tool for student's code: \begin{quote} ``Nothing well integrated and
highly functional, mostly hacky bash/python scripts..." \end{quote} Moreover, he
comments on the current system his institution uses for grading: \begin{quote}
``We don't have a clean web interface or anything and they aren't functional in
the sense that they break for most assignments as soon as errors occur e.g. they
can grade the 100\%'s but not much else." \end{quote}

From a market perspective, the proposed solution is a service because the team
will not deliver a physical product. Instead, users will access the solution
through the Internet. Competing products are open-source, which has lead the
team to use a free of charge business model with revenue in advertisements.
Income from ads will be used to pay for hosting infrastructure to support the
cloud service, including the SSL certificate. It will also pay for any further
work done by developers to update and maintain the cloud service. The business
model is reasonable because the product can easily serve the correct ads due to
the knowledge of the targeted audience that will be using the service.

\subsection{Potential Customers}

The product that the team will develop is aimed to educational institutions that
require evaluation of students' coding assignments. The service can potentially
be used by interviewers and peer to peer collaboration in a company.

\subsection{Current or Potential Competition}

There are some closed code review systems available in various university
institutions like University of Maryland's Kassandra \cite{Matt1994}. There are
some other open source products available as well, like Web-Cat \cite{WebCat}
and Praktomat \cite{Praktomat}. There are also many online judge systems like
UVa \cite{UVA} and SPOJ \cite{SPOJ}. Additionally, many code linters and style
guides exist. Some of these products are outdated (Kassanda, 1994), others
require dedicated infraestructure and installation (WebCat and Praktomat) and
some are not targeted for grading purposes (UVA and SPOJ). Moreover,
none of these competitive products include code quality analyzers.

\subsection{Competitive Advantages}

The main competitive advantage of this product is that it provides a service
that is cloud and web-based. It can analyze code, not just by comparing its
result but by reviewing coding styles. Additionally, this system does not
require any installation at all.
