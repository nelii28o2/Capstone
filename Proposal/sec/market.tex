\autsection{Market Overview}{Daniel Santiago}

The intention of the team is to market this product as a service. It is intended to charge
educational institutions a yearly rate based on the amount of students they
intend to support.

Income will come from subscriptions and these will be used to pay for hosting
infrastructure to support the cloud service, it will also pay for any further
work done by developers to update and maintain the cloud service.

\subsection{Potential Customers}

The product that the team intends to develop is aimed to educational institutions that
require evaluation of student's coding assignments. The service can potentially
be used by interviewers and peer to peer collaboration in a company.

\subsection{Current or Potential Competition}

There are some closed code review systems available in various university
institutions like University of Maryland's Kassandra \cite{Matt1994}. There are
some open source products available as well, like Web-Cat \cite{WebCat} and
Praktomat \cite{Pracktomat}. There are also many online judge systems like UVa
\cite{UVA} and SPOJ \cite{SPOJ}. Additionally, many code linters and style
guides exist. All of these competition products are outdated, they all require
installation on an institution's own infrastructure, and they don't include any
code quality analyzers at all.

\subsection{Competitive Advantages}

The main competitive advantage of this product is that it provides a service that is cloud and
web-based. It is reliable, secure and easy to use. It can throughly analyze
code, not just by comparing its result but by reviewing coding styles.
Additionally, this system does not include any installation or configuration at
all.
