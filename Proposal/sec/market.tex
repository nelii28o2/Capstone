\autsection{Market Overview}{Daniel Santiago}

There are some closed code review systems available in various university
institutions like \cite{Matt} University of Maryland's Kassandra. There are also
many online judge systems like UVa and SPOJ. Additionally, many code linters and
style guides exist. But all these services are not combined into one.

Our intention is to market this product as a service.
