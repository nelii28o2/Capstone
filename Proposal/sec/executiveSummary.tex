\part*{Executive Summary}

Assignments for Software Engineering classes have particular characteristics
that make them time-consuming to grade by professors and teaching assistants. In
the majority of cases, they are handed in electronically. The grader then runs
the code with some specific input to verify its correctness. Students might
choose to use different programming languages, different IDEs, and different
tests, making grading even more difficult. Additionally, many students write
code in different styles, which may make it harder to read for a person that has
been accustomed to a particular coding style. Furthermore, communication between
the grader and the student may be slow, often relying in sluggish e-mail
exchanges. All of this makes grading software assignments an enduring and
tedious task.

The main objective of this project is to design and build a Web-based
application  for eliminating the difficulties that come with grading software
assignments. The application will host repositories that contain students' code.
When a student uploads code for an assignment, the system notifies the grader
and automatically runs test cases previously specified by the grader. The
results of the test cases are sent to the grader. The grader also has the option
to add line-by-line comments to the student's code, and run the application's
linter tools to verify code style. Finally, the grader will have the option to
assign a grade to the student.

The Web application will be fully hosted in the cloud. The goal with this
application is to greatly reduce the time that it takes for professors and
teaching assistants to grade assignments, and to improve the communication
between students and graders. The web application will also promote good coding
practices by giving feedback to the students when they submit their code.

The development milestones for this project will be the finalization of the
front end web client, a complete RESTful back end server, the completion of
the accounts and repositories manager and the culmination of the testing and
quality framework. The end goal of the team is to integrate all of these
components and finally deploy this service in the cloud.

% ROI = return of investment.

The total cost for the project will be \$41,863.87 of development costs and
and additional scalable and recurrent cost for hosting infrastructure in
Amazon Web Services EC2. Expected profitability for this product is very high.
At only \$10,000 per educational institution license, the return of investment
(ROI) will be nearly balanced to \$0 at 5 licenses sold, but the team expects
to sell at least 25 educational licenses.
