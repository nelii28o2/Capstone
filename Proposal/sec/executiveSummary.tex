\begin{abstract} Assignments for software engineering classes have particular
characteristics that make them harder to grade by professors and teaching
assistants. In the majority of cases, they must be handed in electronically. The
grader then runs the code with some specific input to verify the correctness of
the code. Students might choose to use different programming languages,
different IDEs, and different tests, making it even more difficult for grading.
Additionally, many students write code in different styles, which makes it
harder to read for a person that is used to a particular coding style.
Furthermore, communication between the grader and the student is very poor,
often relying in slow e-mail responses.  All of this makes grading Software
assignments an enduring task.

Our product is being designed to eliminate the difficulties that come with
grading software assignments. It is a web-based application that will
host repositories that contain a student's code. When a student uploads code
for an assignment, the system notifies the grader and automatically runs test
cases that were specified by the grader. The result of the test cases is then
sent to the grader. The grader also has the option to add line-by-line comments
to the student's code, and run linter programs to verify code quality and
style. Finally, the grader will have the option to assign a grade to the
student.

The deliverables for this project will be a fully hosted web application. Our
goal with this application is to greatly reduce the time that it takes for
professors to grade assignments, and help communication between students and
graders.

Milestones:
\begin{itemize}
\item Front end web client of the product.
\item Accounts and repositories back end.
\item Testing framework.
\item Code quality framework.

% ROI = return of investment.
The total cost for the project will be \$20,913.46 of development costs and
additional scalable cost for hosting infrastructure in Amazon Web Services EC2.

% Random (willy nilly) license cost.
Expected profitability for this product is very high. At \$10,000 per
educational institution license, our ROI will be nearly balanced to \$0 at 2
licenses sold, but we expect to sell at least 100 educational licenses.

% TODO no se si actually poner esto.
Another revenue model is a constant stream of money with advertisements for the
free peer-to-peer web model.
