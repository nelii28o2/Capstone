\begin{abstract} Assignments for software engineering classes have particular
characteristics that make them harder to grade by professors and teaching
assistants. In the majority of cases, they must be handed in electronically. The
grader then runs the code with some specific input to verify the correctness of
the code. Students might choose to use different programming languages,
different IDEs, and different tests, making it even more difficult for grading.
Additionally, many students write code in different styles, which makes it
harder to read for a person that is used to a particular coding style.
Furthermore, communication between the grader and the student is very poor,
often relying in slow e-mail responses.  All of this makes grading Software
assignments an enduring task.

Our product is being designed to eliminate the difficulties that come with
grading software assignments. It is a web-based application that will
host repositories that contain a student's code. When a student uploads code
for an assignment, the system notifies the grader and automatically runs test
cases that were specified by the grader. The result of the test cases is then
sent to the grader. The grader also has the option to add line-by-line comments
to the student's code, and run linter programs to verify code quality and
style. Finally, the grader will have the option to assign a grade to the
student.
