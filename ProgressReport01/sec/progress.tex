In compliance with the proposed timeline, the design phase was completed in time and Panda Code Reviews is currently in the middle of the software implementation phase of its individual components. Instead of doing user interface mockups as planned, the team decided to do static
pages. This allowed the team to start the implementation earlier than projected. Please refer
to the Gantt chart, which is included in a separate file, to see changes in
schedule and tasks ditribution. The Gantt chart file also contains the tasks that have been completed and the percentage of completion of the rest. The implementation of the revenue system (Google AdSense) cannot be started until there is enough content in the website.

The plan is to continue the timeline established in the Gantt Chart.
