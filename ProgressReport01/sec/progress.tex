Regarding technical design, the project schedule has met the expectations within the alotted time for completion. Implementation was started earlier than projected. Instead of doing mockups as planned, the team decided to do static pages. This helps with the critical path while serving as mockups. Please refer to the Gantt chart, which is included in a separate file for changes in schedule. The Gantt chart also shows the tasks that have been completed.
