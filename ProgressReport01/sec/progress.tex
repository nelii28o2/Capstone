In compliance with the proposed timeline, the design phase was completed in time
and Panda Code Reviews is currently in the software implementation phase of its
individual components. Instead of doing user interface mockups as planned, the
team decided to do static pages with HTML and CSS. This allowed the team to
start the implementation of the front end earlier than projected. Also, a
prototype for compiling and running Java code has been developed. The code is
uploaded to the server via the web application at its front end interface. The
front end passes the uploaded code to the back end with the compilation and
execution query, and the back end executes the instruction, runs the code and
outputs the result back to the front end, which then displays the results to the
user. Please refer to the Gantt chart, which is included in a separate file, to
see changes in schedule and tasks ditribution. The Gantt chart file also
contains the tasks that have been completed and the percentage of completion of
the rest. The implementation of the revenue system (Google AdSense) cannot be
started until there is enough content in the website.

The plan is to continue the timeline established in the Gantt Chart.
