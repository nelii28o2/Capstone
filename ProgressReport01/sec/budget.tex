As of September 30, 2013 project expenditure totals at
\$4194.76. This total includes a cost of \$12.76 for the servers. From the
project start date, 3 direct billable weeks have elapsed. Labor and benefit
costs were estimated at \$4,182. Since no overtime has been payed out and work
pace remains as projected, employment budget is 33.33\% consumed.

The current server cost are to the on-demand use of the EC2 instance for the web
app server, and the newly added instance of GitLab. It is required to do a
budget update that includes the new GitLab instance, but this should not
translate to a significant increase in budget expense since it was already
implicitly included in the previous analysis.

For the remaining of the project, the team expects to remain on budget.
