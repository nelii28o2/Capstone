\autsection{Budget Analysis}{Daniel Santiago}

As of September 30, 2013 project expenditure totals at \$4,194.76. This total
includes a cost of \$12.76 for the development Amazon EC2 Instances and the 3
direct billable weeks that have elapsed since the start of the project. As a
consequence, labor and benefit costs were \$4,182. Since no overtime has been
payed out and work pace remains as projected, employment budget has been
consumed by 33.33\%.

The current server cost are for the on-demand use of the EC2 instance that hosts
the web app server and the newly added instance of GitLab. A budget update is
not required for the new GitLab instance since the Amazon EC2 M1 instance was
already included in the previous analysis.

For the remaining of the project, the team expects to remain on budget.
