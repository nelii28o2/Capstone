\autsection{Future Work and Conclusions}{Nelián Colón}

Team Aguacate built a web application, Panda Code Reviews, for reducing the difficulties of grading coding assignments. All proposed objectives were met on time and within budget. Panda features a source code viewer with syntax highlighting, and a code quality analyzer, an account manager, a repository manager and a test manager. Panda stands from other similar products, such as WebCat \cite{WebCat}, because it is cloud based and it performs code quality analysis.

Panda represents a relief for code assignments graders because it reduces some of the complexities of this task. Since the project is web based, it does not translate into a significant environmental impact other than the computers' power consumption.

Currently, due to time constraints, Panda Code Reviews only works for java code assignments. The system was done so that support for other languages could be easily done. Future work may include adding support for other languages as well as more code quality metrics, such as plagiarism check. This changes would make this product more markatable and will make it stand even more from the competition.
