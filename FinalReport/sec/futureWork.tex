\autsection{Future Work and Conclusions}{Nelián Colón}

Team Aguacate built a web application, Panda Code Reviews, for reducing the difficulties of grading coding assignments. All proposed objectives were met on time and within budget. Panda features a source code viewer with syntax highlighting, and a code quality analyzer, an account manager, a repository manager and a test manager. Panda stands out from other similar products, such as WebCat \cite{WebCat}, because it is cloud based and it performs code quality analysis.

Panda presents a relief for code assignments graders because it reduces some of the complexities of this task and saves him/her time. It helps with the communication between the grader and the students. Since the project is web based, it does not translate into a significant environmental impact other than the computers' power consumption. Moreover, there are no ethical nor legal aspects regarding the development nor the deployment of Panda Code Reviews.

Currently, due to time constraints, Panda Code Reviews only works for java code assignments. The system was done so that support for other languages could be easily added. Future work may include adding support for other languages as well as more code quality metrics, such as plagiarism check. This changes would make this product more marketable and will make it stand out even more from the competition.
