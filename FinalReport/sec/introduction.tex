\autsection{Introduction}{Samuel Rodr√≠guez}

Most educational institutions manually grade coding assignments completed by
students \cite{Cheang2003}. Manual evaluation of code takes a great deal of time and is prone to
bad evaluations due to the substantial amount of different ways a program can be
written. Sometimes, this leads the grader to only evaluate the program's output
based on a specific input.

%% la porqueria de hoja de evaluacion dice que hay que poner toda la literatura
%% que tiene que ver con absolutamente todos los aspectos del proyecto en la intro.
%% look for this in proposal.
Panda Code Reviews is a web-based automatic code grader. The main objective of
this product is to eliminate the difficulties that come with grading software assignments.
The application design is shown throughout this report. Implementation
phase has been finished and the production version of the service is already
residing on the cloud. No changes were made to the initially proposed design;
there only were some minor changes in schedule that did no affect the final deadline
of the delivery of the product.

%% chequeate bien este parrafo porque esta medio sketchy.
%% this is the organization of the rest of the report.
The following section contains detailed system specifications.
The specifications are followed by a section that explains all methods and approaches
used during the development of the project. A market overview section follows, and then a budget analysis that summarizes the total expenditure of the
development of the project. Finally, future work and conclusions will be presented, followed
by references of all cited work.
