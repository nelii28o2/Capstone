Accurate estimates of cost was always extremely important for ensuring that the team
did not go over budget. Since this is a software project, the majority of the
cost was attributed to Software Developers and Human Resources. Development costs
remained low since computer workstations and an internet connection was
provided at all times. An Amazon EC2 web services instance was purchased for the development and the final deployment of the product.

\subsection{Project Estimated Cost}
The total estimated cost of the project is \$42,791.87 plus recurrent costs
after deployment. The broke down details can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:detailedBudget}.

\subsection{Project Actual Cost}
%% some extra stuff
The project expenditure totaled at \$42,081.23. This total
includes a cost of \$217.36 for the development Amazon EC2 Instances and the 9 billable weeks that have elapsed since the start of the project. What saved money for Team Aguacate was by using a free self signed SSL certificate, and by lowering the Amazon EC2 instance costs. The team managed to save 1.66\% of the initial budget.
