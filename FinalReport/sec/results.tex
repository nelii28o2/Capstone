\subsection{Environmental impact}
The only environmental impact caused by Panda Code Reviews is the power consumption of the
servers that host the web application and of the client's computers. There are no viable
alternatives to solve this problem, since the servers are needed to run the application and
the clients need to access the system with a computer. A positive environmental impact of
Panda Code Reviews is that it saves paper from being used for correction of software
assignments.

Panda Code Reviews helps with the communication between the graders and the students. It
helps the grader by saving time. The grader can use this time to have a healthy social life.
